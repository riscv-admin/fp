# FP SIG meeting minutes - 2024-11-11

Present:
- Kenneth Rovers (Imagination)
- Al Martin (Akeana)
- Bing Yu (Andes)
- Peter Tang (Rivos)
- Nicolas Brunie (SiFive)

Topic(s):
- Support for smaller FP formats
    - Andrew's position: only support for conversions to larger formats (no actual new operation)
    - Evaluating practicality of Andrew's solution?
        - What level of performance would it offer? How would it work in software?
        - on integer side: dot8 is used quite a lot
        - operations may often used mixed-format (more opcode required if we need to support all combinations)
        - [AM: we already have a BF16,FP32 widening FMA in Zvfbfwma]
    - There is definitely the intent to only add useful operation (e.g. exclude div/sqrt from Zvfbfa even if no new opcodes would be needed and HW cost would be small)
    - Block floating-point format: what is the split between hardware and software for RISC-V support
    - AM: would be interesting to look at actual code that uses MX Formats
    - Vector SIG would certainly own this (over the FP SIG)

- SIMD FP on the scalar side (FP version of P extension)
    - use cases for DSP
    - no sure about the traction
    - Why not use a 32 or 64-bit Vector Unit? (VLEN can be as small as 32-bit)
    - for very cost sensitive micro-controller (the one with Zfinx)
    - Could a smaller Zv32f be the solution?
